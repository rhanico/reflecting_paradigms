Functional Programming
Data Immutability: This solution ensures data immutability because it doesn't modify the original input list. It creates a new list without changing the original data.

Pure Function: Yes, this solution is a pure function because it only depends on its input.

Higher-Order Function: No, it's not a higher-order function because it doesn't take arguments or return functions.

Alternative Programming Style: No, this solution simplifies the process and won't alter the original data, making it suitable for this problem.

Advantages of Functional Programming: Functional programming keeps data safe and uses pure functions, making it helpful for maintaining data integrity.


-----

Object-Oriented Programming
Encapsulation: This solution demonstrates encapsulation by encapsulating data and behavior, hiding implementation details.

Inheritance: AnakinsPod and SebulbasPod inherit attributes and methods from the base class Podracer.

Abstraction: These classes provide abstractions for working with podracer objects by defining methods like repair and boost.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism is not demonstrated in this solution.

Coding Style: For organizing and modeling, Object-Oriented Programming is easier because it allows for clear structuring of data and behavior.

Role of Object-Oriented Programming: OOP helps in modeling and organizing objects with their behaviors.

Reflection
Better Paradigm: The choice between paradigms depends on the goal and problem presented. Both have their merits.

Appealing Paradigm: The choice of paradigm depends on the project. Functional programming is appealing for data processing, while OOP is ideal for modeling and organizing objects.

Tasks Suitable for Each Paradigm: Functional programming is suitable for data transformation, filtering, and mapping. OOP is ideal for modeling objects with behaviors.

Understanding Complexity: Both paradigms have their complexities, and deepening understanding requires practice and working on projects that require each paradigm.
